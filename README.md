# GSAP Image Loader Animation

This project showcases a loading animation and image gallery built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). The animation includes a pre-loader with a counter that animates as the page loads, followed by a smooth transition to a gallery of images.

## Features

- **Smooth Transitions**: GSAP-powered animations for smooth transitions.
- **Dynamic Content**: Dynamically created elements for the counter digits.
